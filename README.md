This guide demonstrates building an application with the following components.

<app-root>—the first component to load and the container for the other components.
<app-top-bar>—the store name and checkout button.
<app-product-list>—the product list.
<app-product-alerts>—a component that contains the application's alerts.

To create the sample project, generate the ready-made sample project in StackBlitz.

The preview features two areas:

a top bar with the store name, My Store, and a checkout button
a header for a product list, Products

The project section on the left shows the source files that make up the application, including the infrastructure and configuration files.

When you generate the StackBlitz example applications that accompany the tutorials, StackBlitz creates the starter files and mock data for you. The files you use throughout the tutorial are in the src folder.
